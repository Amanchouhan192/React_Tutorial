```React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We'll get to the funny XML-like tags in a second. Your components tell React what you want to render â€“ then React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.```
# How to [**Install**](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and **Create** the react app.
* For intalling the react in you machine 
 * open the CMD and type the command
 
 ```npm install -g create-react-app```
